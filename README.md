# post_data_to_api_from_postgres


This is a program that calculates the distance between two geographic locations. It leverages a PostgreSQL database and a Python API to accomplish this task. Here's an explanation of the process:

1. **Database Procedure in PostgreSQL**: You have a procedure in your PostgreSQL database. This procedure takes the names of two geographic locations as input parameters. These locations are typically specified by names, such as city names or coordinates (latitude and longitude).

2. **Python API**: You have a Python application that acts as an API. This Python API is responsible for interacting with the PostgreSQL database. It receives the names of two locations as input data.

3. **Distance Calculation**: The Python API takes the location names and uses a geographic library or algorithm to calculate the distance between these two points. The distance is typically measured in miles or kilometers.

4. **Database Table**: The calculated distance is then inserted into a database table, likely in the PostgreSQL database. This table may store records of distances between various location pairs.

In summary, this program integrates a PostgreSQL database with a Python API to compute distances between two geographic locations and stores the results in a database table. It's a common use case for applications that involve geospatial data and distance calculations, such as mapping and location-based services.
